Images for every stage of the vehicle detection and tracking pipeline:

*_pre_heat_map           â€”-> Image after using HOG, Spatial Binning of Color, Histograms of Color, a Linear SVM and a sliding 								 window search 
*_heat_pre_threshold     --> Heat-Map before applying the threshold
*_heat_post_threshold    --> Heat-Map after applying the threshold
*_post_heat_map          --> Final output shown on original image
